Ingrediences
Rice flour – choose pure rice flour for this recipe, not ground rice which can be coarse in texture. You will need powdered rice (100% rice flour)
Oil – any flavourless cooking oil works fine. I use sunflower oil. If the oil has a strong taste, you will be able to taste it in the roti
Salt – any fine table salt works
You’ll also need hot water for binding the dough

Soft and tearable gluten free roti is both easy to make and delicious. A step-by-step recipe for the Indian flatbread, roti, made without wheat flour. Only 3 ingredients! Serve these tender rice flour-based rotis with your favourite curry dishes, alongside daal, or use them as wraps. They puff up, fold, bend, wrap and tear just like regular roti. No need for any special ingredients.

Prep Time: 15 minutes
Cook Time: 25 minutes
Additional Time: 10 minutes
Total Time: 50 minutes


Ingredients
340g rice flour
1 1/2 tbsp oil
1/2 tsp salt
425ml water

Instructions
- Boil the water in a large saucepan. Add salt and stir. Switch the gas off.
- Tip the rice flour into the water and stir with the end of a rolling pin or wooden spoon until a coarse, shaggy dough is formed. Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and allow to stand for 10 minutes. Do not leave it any longer as the dough must be kneaded while it is hot.
- Remove the lid from the pan and transfer the mixture to a wide kneading plate (parat), or onto a clean work surface. Add the oil.
Since the dough will be very hot, knead the mixture using the base of a small bowl or with a flexible spatula until cool enough to handle.
Once the mixture is has cooled slightly, knead the dough using your hands until soft and smooth, about 6-7 minutes. Portion the dough into 10 pieces. Make 8 pieces for larger rotis. Cover with cling film to prevent drying.
Take one portion of dough at a time and knead once more (for about a minute) before you begin to roll. The kneading activates the starch in the rice which will prevent the dough from cracking. Watch my video tutorial below for a visual technique.
Pre-heat a tawa or frying pan over medium-high heat.
Dust the dough and work surface with a small amount of extra rice flour and begin to roll into a circle, about 18-cm (7-inches) wide. The edges may begin to crack a little and appear jagged - this is normal. If you don't mind, you can move on to step 9, or alternatively, go to the next step to tidy this up.
Take a round saucepan lid, about 16.5 cm (6.5-inches) wide, or very slightly smaller than the roti you've rolled. Use it like a cookie cutter, pressing it directly into the roti to cut the jagged edges off. You should be left with a perfect circle.
Place the roti directly onto the pre-heated tawa. Cook for 10 seconds before turning the roti over using a turner or spatula. Cook for 20-30 seconds, until light brown spots appear on the side that's being cooked. You can now turn the roti once more to cook the first side for another 15 seconds. Alternatively, you can use a pair of tongs to transfer the roti to an open flame (topped with a metal grate if required). This will cause the roti to puff up and char for the classic grill marks. If you don't feel confident to do this, simply cook it through on the tawa or frying pan.
Place the roti inside an insulated container. Spread with butter if desired.
Repeat these steps for the remaining dough, creating a stack of rotis which will stay soft and foldable for a few hours.


Notes
The warmer the dough is kept whilst kneading, the easier it will be to work with.

Do not pre-roll all the rotis at once. Roll one at a time and cook immediately before moving on to the next.

These rotis are not suitable for freezing.
